In this project, the user inputs his name, phone number, and date to get access to our awesome inventory. Inventory.txt is used to extract products to array and extract the price, name, and ID of the products. The user should input numbers 1-6 to choose the desired product (based on products ID), if the number is outside of the range, then the program will ask for the input again. Price will be outputted alongside with promotional offer (if available) After that user gets to choose whether he wants to add another item by inputting yes/no (case does not matter) and the process repeats till the user inputs no to the repeat request. The bill/receipt gets outputted containing the item name, price, units, and total. Also, the program asks the user to input yes/no based on whether the user wants to get a copy of it in the bill.txt file. Overall, the program was tested multiple times using out of range/ negative values and wrong inputs to make sure that the user gets a chance to enter new input if he mistyped the input.
